the end of each case study. In case, a submission is found to be copied, not
more than 70% of total marks will be given, irrespective of whether someone has
copied or get copied. In case of delayed submission, for each delayed week
(ranges from the first day of the week to the last day of that week), 1 mark
will be deducted from the total earned marks.

assignment task. No submission will be considered, if assignment is received through
